Scripts in this directory: 

generate-data.py 
Usage: python generate-data.py [number of couples to generate]
Description: This python scripts generates 4 files of data that all use the same couple set of participant ids and contain all the information needed to input into the system. Once the files are generated, you can place them in the res/raw folder in the Android project for them to be used. If data is not being imported, make sure the testCSVImport function called in the onCreate of the LoginActivity is taking 'true' as a parameter. 
Dependencies: Python 2.7+ (I haven't tested with with Python 3.2+). For more information on installing Python, please see https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest Python 2 release.
